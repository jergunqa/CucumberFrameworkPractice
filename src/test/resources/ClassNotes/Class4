Maven is a build automation tool which helps us to manage dependencies and plugins and lets us to run our
test properly. The heart of Maven is pom.xml file

Maven has 3 basic(built-in) cycles:
1. default - handles your project's deployment
2. clean - handles your project's cleaning
3. site - handles any project's site documentation

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

******project depends on jars, they are dependencies******
