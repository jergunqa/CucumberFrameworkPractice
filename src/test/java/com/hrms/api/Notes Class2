What is a webservice?
Webservice is a method of communication through which two machines will exchange data irrespective of their underlying architecture
All WebServices are APis but not all APIs are websservices
Webservices are independent of the language and operating system.
What is HTTP?
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents
Types of API with web services:We know that APIs hosted over internet are called web services,
now these web services must follow some standard protocol or architecture in order to be able to communicateOver the internet.
So the standards of APIs on internet are various ranging from SOAP ,XML-RPC ,JSON-RPC, RESTSOAPï uses
XML as a format to transfer data. Its main function is to define the structure of the messages and
methods of communication. IN addition to that the underlying medium used is HttpBut the options of http
available are only POST and GET calls.
XMPL-RPCï uses a specific XML format to transfer data compared to SOAP that uses a proprietary XM
L formatJSON-RPCï XML-RPC but instead of using XML format to transfer data it uses JSONRESTï is not
 a protocol like the other web services, instead, it is a set of architectural principles. The REST service
 needs to have certain characteristics, including simple interfaces, which are resources identified easily
 within the request and manipulation of resources using the interface.
