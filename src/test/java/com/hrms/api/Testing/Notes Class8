We don't have postman or any other software tool?
How can we test are Apis?


We know Java.
 1. we need API documentation (details how to API can be used)
 2. Send HTTP request to the server --> using Java
 3. Get the response from the server and using java parse that response and write test cases.

we know Java, now we send request to our server
1. Our server accepts HTTP request
HTTP is a protocol
  1. Write HTTP protocol in Java and send our request to the server.

 Http client();
 Rest assured();

 RestAssured()-->
 Developed to Test the Restful web services
 RestAssured follows the BDD approach
  1. Given() --> To prepare the request we use given().
  2. When() --> What type of call you are making.
  3. Then() --> Verify

 1. Create an Employee;
 a. URI --> BaseURI == RestAssured.baseURI = "http://3.237.189.167/syntaxapi/api"";
 b. Given() --> headers(authorization, content-type, body) --> returntype --> object() -->requestSpecification
 c. When() --> calltype (Post(/createEmployee.php));-->returntype-->Response
 We have the response of our HTTP request.
 d. Then() -->to write our test cases
